}

PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: Your most important goal is to preserve the semantic integrity of the paper's logical sections.
- A single, continuous "Methodology" section in the source text must NOT be split into multiple chunks with the same sectionPath. It should be one chunk.
- The same applies to other core sections like "Introduction", "Results", "Discussion", and "Conclusion".
- Only split a major section if it is exceptionally long (over 10,000 characters) AND contains clear, distinct sub-headings.

Additional Rules:
- Chunk size should be secondary to logical coherence.
- Chunks for tables and their captions must be separate and marked with kind="table" or kind="caption".
- sectionPath should reflect the hierarchy from the outline. For a subsection "2.1 Data analysis" under "2. Methodology", the path would be ["Methodology", "Data analysis"].

Allowed Entity Types: [{{all_concepts}}]
Rules:
- Extract specific instances (e.g., "Morrison Formation", "Tyrannosaurus rex"), not general concepts.
- Use the provided candidate hints to guide stratigraphy extraction.
- Return STRICT JSON array of entities: [{ "name": "string", "type": "string", "confidence": number, "justification": "string" }]. If none are found, return an empty array [].

You are an ontologist building a knowledge graph for deep-time research. Comprehensively extract ALL potential named entities.
Process:
1. Extract all specific nouns/phrases for key concepts.
2. Assign a type: Prioritize an existing type, or propose a NEW PascalCase type if no good fit exists.
Existing Schema Types: [{{schema_concepts}}]
Return STRICT JSON of schema below. No prose.

You are an expert AI specializing in geological knowledge extraction with strict ontology adherence.
Task: Extract Subject-Predicate-Object triples.
CRITICAL RULES:
1. USE ONLY PROVIDED ENTITIES: Subjects and objects MUST be from the "Typed Entity List".
2. STRICTLY ADHERE TO ONTOLOGY: Subject/object types must match the predicate's Domain/Range from the "Predicate Reference Guide".
3. EVIDENCE IS MANDATORY: Every triple needs a direct quote.
